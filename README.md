## Statement of Problem
Aggressive behavior triggered by stressful situations in which people have little to no control can be very difficult to mediate. Aggression is known to cause feelings of irritability and restlessness, and it can be helpful and beneficial for people to recognize the state of anger they are in. Particularly with quarantine and COVID-19, people have been much more actively playing video games as a means to spend time with friends and family (or other online players). However, "toxicity" or gamer aggression, is also on the rise. This increased aggression can impact an individual's mood, relationships, and can carry on post-gaming sessions. It can be incredibly valuable to create an inexpensive tool that can recognize these anger levels and gently make the user aware of their mental state. The tool can then implement light color therapy in order to help the user cool down and verbally suggest they take a short break from the activity.
## Design Objectives
It can be incredibly valuable to create an inexpensive tool that can recognize these anger levels and gently make the user aware of their mental state. The tool can then implement light color therapy in order to help the user cool down and verbally or visually suggest they take a short break from the activity, or other feedback depending on context (gaming, driving, heated discussions among couples, childcare, etc.).
